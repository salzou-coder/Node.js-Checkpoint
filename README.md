## Email Sender (Nodemailer)

Nodemailer is configured to send emails using Gmail.

Due to Google security restrictions (App Password required) and loss of access
to the Gmail account password, the email could not be sent successfully.

However, the Nodemailer configuration and implementation are correct
according to the official documentation.
